The following CSS code snippet attempts to style an element with a background image, but it fails to display correctly due to an uncommon error: 
```css
.element {
  background-image: url(image.png);
  background-size: cover;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```
The issue arises when `image.png` is not found in the same directory as the CSS file, and the relative path is incorrect or missing.  This is a common issue when working with relative paths in CSS, but often overlooked by beginners.
