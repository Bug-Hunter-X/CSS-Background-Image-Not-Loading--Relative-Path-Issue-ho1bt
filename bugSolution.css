The corrected CSS code snippet uses a correctly specified relative path to ensure that the background image is loaded correctly:
```css
.element {
  background-image: url('./images/image.png'); /* Correct path */
  background-size: cover;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```
This solution assumes that the `image.png` file is located in a subdirectory named `images` within the same directory as the CSS file. Adjust the path as needed to match your file structure.  Always double-check your relative paths when referencing external resources in CSS.
